# Title Verification System â€“ Week 4 Progress

## Overview

In Week 4, we continued refining our similarity detection methods and started integrating the backend with Flask for API development. This phase aimed to make the title verification functionality accessible through an API service.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Backend Development with Flask
- Created **API endpoints** for title verification.
- Integrated **similarity detection methods** (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Phonetic Matching) into the backend.
- Developed a **response structure** to return verification scores and title recommendations to users.

### 2. Data Normalization Improvements
- Expanded **phonetic matching rules** to handle more title variations.
- Improved **text preprocessing** by addressing special cases like abbreviations and compound words.
- Enhanced **tokenization and stopword removal** to further refine the matching process.

## Summary of Week 4 Achievements
- **Backend API** successfully implemented using Flask.
- **Phonetic matching and text preprocessing** further refined.
- **Overall title verification accuracy** significantly improved.
