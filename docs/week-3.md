# Title Verification System â€“ Week 3 Progress

## Overview

In Week 3, we focused on implementing advanced text normalization techniques and developing the first version of our similarity detection model using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Text Normalization
- Applied **stemming and lemmatization** to ensure consistency in title comparisons.
- Removed **stop words** from both English and Hindi titles.
- Standardized **Hindi titles** by normalizing Unicode variations.

### 2. Initial Similarity Detection
- Implemented **TF-IDF vectorization** to numerically represent the titles.
- Calculated **Cosine Similarity scores** to measure similarity between titles.
- Set up **initial threshold values** for similarity classification.

### 3. Testing & Validation
- Conducted **testing using sample title pairs** to fine-tune similarity thresholds.
- **Verified accuracy** by manually checking top matches against the dataset.

---

## Next Steps
- Implement **Metaphone** for phonetic similarity matching.
- Integrate **prefix and suffix removal** for improving comparison accuracy.
- Develop the **verification probability calculation logic** for final title approval.
