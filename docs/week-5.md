# Title Verification System â€“ Week 5 Progress

## Overview

In Week 5, we focused on integrating the frontend with the Flask backend and refining the verification logic. This phase made the system accessible for users through a basic user interface and strengthened the title similarity detection system.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Frontend Integration
- Developed a **simple and user-friendly interface** for title verification.
- Connected the **frontend to the Flask API** to send title verification requests.
- Displayed **similarity scores and verification results** dynamically on the user interface.

### 2. Enhanced Verification Logic
- Set a **uniqueness threshold** at **70%** similarity.
- Titles with **similarity above 80% are marked as similar** and flagged for rejection.
- Fine-tuned the **similarity calculations** based on extensive testing and sample title verifications.

## Summary of Week 5 Achievements
- **Basic frontend interface** implemented and connected to the backend API.
- **Similarity thresholds** clearly defined for title classification (Unique vs. Similar).
- **Improved presentation** of verification results for a better user experience.

âœ… Week 5 completed successfully! System is now fully functional from frontend to backend, allowing users to verify titles interactively. Preparing for optimization and deployment in the upcoming weeks! ðŸš€
