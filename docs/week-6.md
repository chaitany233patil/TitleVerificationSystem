## Tasks Completed

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Optimized TF-IDF vectorization** for faster and more efficient similarity computation.
- **Reduced API response times** by implementing **caching techniques** for frequently verified titles.
- **Implemented batch processing** to handle multiple title verifications in a single request efficiently.

### 2. Dataset Validation Enhancements
- Added **cross-validation tests** to verify accuracy and robustness of the title verification system.
- **Cleaned and filtered** the dataset further for better prediction consistency.
- **Improved phonetic matching rules** to better handle variations found in real-world title data.
